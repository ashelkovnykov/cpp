# Identifiers

An identifier is a name used to refer to a C++ entity. Identifiers can be of arbitrary length, but must begin with a non-digit character. An identifier can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and Unicode characters.

Identifiers can refer to the following entites:
* Objects
* References
* Functions
* Enumerations
* Types
* Class members
* Namespaces
* Templates
* Labels
* Macros and macro parameters

Some identifier names are reserved by the language and therefore cannot be used. These include:
* Language keywords
* Identifiers beginning with two underscores
* Identifiers beginning with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter
* Identifiers beginning with an underscore in the global namespace 

The full list of reserved identifiers can be found online.

## Label
  
A label is an identifier which refers to a statement. Labels have no effect on the execution of instructions on their own. However, jump statements can target labels as a method of controlling the flow of the program.
