# Memory Model

The C++ memory model is built around **bytes**. A 'byte' is the smallest addressable unit of memory. The C++ standard defines that a byte must be large enough to hold the value of any basic execution character set and any UTF-8 character. Therefore, a byte must be at least 8 bits in size.
